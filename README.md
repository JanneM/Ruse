Ruse
====

A command-line utility to periodically measure the resource use of a process and its subprocesses. Currently it measures only execution time and memory use (by total RSS), in much the same way as the Slurm .  

The purpose is to let Slurm users estimate the needed memory and execution time of their individual processes, presented in a way that is easily understood also for the non-specialist.
