Ruse
====

A command-line utility to periodically measure the resource use of a process and its subprocesses. Currently it measures only execution time and memory use (by total RSS), in much the same way as the Slurm job scheduler.  

The purpose is to let Slurm users find the memory and execution time they need for their individual programs, presented in a way that is straightforward to understand also for the non-specialist.
